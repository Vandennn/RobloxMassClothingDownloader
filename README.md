# RobloxMassClothingDownloader
Script to auto download an entire groups clothing (Shirts and Pants)

# Setup
To set this up run "pip -r requirements.txt" and create a folder in the same folder where main.py is stored named "output".

# Configuration
For configuration, copy the name of the group you want to steal the clothing from and paste it into the groupName variable.
# Features
- Auto-download multiple roblox shirts and pants at a time
- Saved clothing template will have shirt name set as it automatically (no need to name while uploading)
- Very quick for downloading (if you aren't rate-limited)

# Possible Issues
Possible issues when using this script will be rate-limits, group and clothing names, and UGC hats.
- For rate-limits simply wait a minute or two to re-run the script. Rate-limits will not occur with large amounts of clothing being downloaded, only when you re-run the script multiple times in a short period of time.
- For group names if you are having issues with it and it's giving you errors, just copy it from the group URL and manually paste it into the scanner function.
- For shirt names make an issue post and I will see why there is an issue with it and update the code.
- For UGC hats I have yet to look at them but I will be updating this when I get the time (I am lazy).
